### Specifications: Dart language — Backend

### This repo contains Dart concepts I have been learning & practicing. </br>
The idea behind this project is to create a program that allows the user to display a list of produts commonly found in a supermarket, then the user will be able to choose what they need by first typing "V" to display all a list of all products available and then choosing what they need by typing the first letter, for instance, should the user feels like buying onions, the letter to type would be "O"— lastly, by typing "C", the user will be able to pay the total amount that will be displayed on screen.
